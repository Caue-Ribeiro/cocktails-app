# My Cocktails App

### I'm currently learning React and this time I'm sharing this cocktails project to practice some skills I've learned lately as hooks, react query, router, styled components, axios, etc. It's a simple project, I developed mainly to practice Routers. You can search many drinks in this cocktails API, read some information about it and there is also a prototype Form of newsletter, I got some random API only to post this information. As soon as I learn more interesting stuff, I come back here to post more. Thank you! ðŸ˜ƒðŸš€ðŸš€
